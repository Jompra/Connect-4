# Connect 4

Whilst mentoring students from the Software Engineering Immersive I decided to have a quick go at making some of the project 1 briefs myself.

I had an idea that detecting the win conditions of a game of connect four is essentially just looking for whether certain patterns of a certain number can be found in the game's board. I'd not had much need to use regular expressions for my other projects so I decided that I'd use this game to have a play.

As per usual the styling is basic but it's enough to play.
